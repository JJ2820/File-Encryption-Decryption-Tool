# File-Encryption-Decryption-Tool
Building a File Encryption/Decryption Tool in C with file I/O and basic cryptographic concepts.
This program takes an input filename, an output filename, and an encryption key as user input. It then reads the contents of the input file, encrypts them using a simple XOR operation with the key, and writes the result to the output file.
